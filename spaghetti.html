        <li>Add the sauce and cook for a while in the meat juice for about 2 to 3 minutes then add some water to thin it out.</li>
        <li>Break the spaghetti into 2 to 3 parts (if this is a taboo for you you can just cook it 'as is') and add it into a hot boiling Water</li>
        <li>Add salt to taste and cook for about 8 minutes then take it off the heat and drain the Water.</li>
        <li>Add the boiled pasta to the sauce together with the mixed vegetables, sliced Tomatoes, and the rest of the scallions.</li>
        <li>Allow it to come to a simmer for about 3 more minutes and take it off the heat.</li>
